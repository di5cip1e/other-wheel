## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- JavaScript enabled
- Minimum screen resolution: 800x600
- Recommended: 1920x1080 or higher for best experience

### First Launch

1. Open the game in your web browser
2. You'll see the main menu with options to:
   - **Play Now**: Start with default settings
   - **Create Game**: Customize your game
   - **Load Preset**: Use a saved configuration
   - **Tutorial**: Learn the basics

### Quick Start

Click "Play Now" to jump right in with a simple two-wheel setup:
- **Outer Wheel**: 8 wedges with various prizes
- **Inner Wheel**: 4 multiplier wedges
- **Single Player**: Just you vs. the wheels

## Basic Gameplay

### How to Spin

1. **Power Selection**: Click "Start Spin" to begin the power meter
2. **Timing**: Watch the oscillating power bar and click "Stop" when you want to capture that power level
3. **Physics**: The wheels will spin based on your selected power, with realistic physics simulation
4. **Results**: Both wheels will eventually stop, showing your selected wedges

### Understanding the Wheels

#### Outer Wheel (Main Wheel)
- Contains the primary prizes or outcomes
- Spins independently based on your power selection
- Larger radius means more momentum

#### Inner Wheel (Bonus Wheel)
- Connected to the outer wheel through a "clutch" mechanism
- Receives torque from the outer wheel based on the clutch ratio
- Often contains multipliers or bonus effects

### Power Meter System

The power meter is your primary control mechanism:

- **Low Power (0-30%)**: Gentle spin, predictable results
- **Medium Power (30-70%)**: Balanced spin with good momentum
- **High Power (70-100%)**: Powerful spin with longer duration

**Pro Tip**: Higher power doesn't always mean better results - sometimes precision matters more than power!

### Physics Simulation

The game uses realistic physics:

- **Friction**: Wheels gradually slow down due to friction
- **Clutch Mechanics**: Inner wheel receives torque from outer wheel
- **Momentum**: Heavier wheels (more wedges) have more momentum
- **Deterministic**: Same power + same seed = same result

## Game Editor

### Accessing the Editor

1. From the main menu, click "Create Game"
2. Or during gameplay, click the "Edit" button
3. The editor opens with tabs for different customization options

### Wheel Configuration

#### Adding/Removing Wedges

1. **Add Wedge**: Click the "+" button on the wheel
2. **Remove Wedge**: Click the "Ã—" button on any wedge
3. **Reorder**: Drag wedges to rearrange them

#### Wedge Properties

Each wedge can be customized:

- **Label**: Text displayed on the wedge (max 20 characters)
- **Weight**: Probability weight (higher = more likely to be selected)
- **Color**: Visual appearance (color picker or hex code)
- **Media**: Optional image or video content

#### Wheel Physics

Adjust the physical properties:

- **Friction Coefficient**: How quickly the wheel slows down (0.01-0.1)
- **Clutch Ratio**: How much torque transfers to inner wheel (0.0-1.0)
- **Radius**: Visual size of the wheel (affects momentum)

### Media Support

#### Adding Images

1. Click "Add Media" on a wedge
2. Choose "Image" type
3. Either:
   - **Upload**: Select a file from your device (JPG, PNG, GIF)
   - **URL**: Enter a web address for an online image
4. Add alt text for accessibility

#### Adding Videos

1. Choose "Video" type
2. Upload or link to video file (MP4, WebM)
3. Videos will auto-play when the wedge is selected
4. Keep videos short (under 10 seconds) for best experience

#### Media Guidelines

- **Image Size**: Recommended 400x400 pixels or smaller
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for good performance
- **Format**: Use web-optimized formats (JPG for photos, PNG for graphics)
