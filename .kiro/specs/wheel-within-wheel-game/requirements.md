# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing simple HTML double wheel spinner into a comprehensive "Wheel within a Wheel" browser-based hot-seat multiplayer game. The enhanced game will feature sophisticated physics simulation, comprehensive customization capabilities, rich media support, and a complete game editor while preserving the core spinning mechanics that already work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Dual-Wheel Physics System

**User Story:** As a player, I want realistic wheel physics with clutch mechanics, so that the inner wheel responds naturally to the outer wheel's motion and creates engaging gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the outer wheel spins THEN the inner wheel SHALL respond according to a configurable clutchRatio parameter (0.0-1.0)
2. WHEN wheels are spinning THEN they SHALL decelerate according to configurable friction coefficients
3. WHEN using deterministic RNG with the same seed THEN the simulation SHALL produce identical results every time
4. WHEN the simulation runs THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps on modern desktop browsers
5. IF clutchRatio is 0.0 THEN the inner wheel SHALL remain stationary regardless of outer wheel motion
6. IF clutchRatio is 1.0 THEN the inner wheel SHALL receive maximum torque transfer from the outer wheel

### Requirement 2: Skill-Based Power Selection System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control spin power through timing skill, so that the game requires player skill rather than pure chance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player starts a spin THEN an oscillating power meter SHALL appear
2. WHEN a player stops the power meter THEN the captured power level SHALL determine initial wheel velocity
3. WHEN power is at maximum THEN the wheels SHALL spin with maximum configured angular velocity
4. WHEN power is at minimum THEN the wheels SHALL spin with minimal angular velocity
5. IF the power meter oscillates THEN it SHALL move smoothly between 0% and 100% power levels

### Requirement 3: Hot-Seat Multiplayer System

**User Story:** As a group of friends, I want to play turn-based multiplayer on one device, so that we can enjoy the game together without needing multiple devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a game THEN players SHALL be able to add 2-8 players with custom names
2. WHEN a game is active THEN the current player SHALL be clearly indicated
3. WHEN a player completes their turn THEN the game SHALL automatically advance to the next player
4. WHEN all players complete a round THEN the game SHALL track and display scores
5. IF a player's turn ends THEN their result SHALL be recorded and displayed

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Game Editor

**User Story:** As a game creator, I want to fully customize wheels, wedges, and game rules, so that I can create unique game experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a wheel THEN users SHALL be able to add, remove, and modify wedges
2. WHEN editing a wedge THEN users SHALL be able to set label, weight, and media content
3. WHEN setting wedge weights THEN the probability of selection SHALL match the configured weights regardless of visual size
4. WHEN editing wheel properties THEN users SHALL be able to adjust friction and clutch ratio parameters
5. IF a wedge has media content THEN it SHALL support text, images, and videos
6. WHEN creating rules THEN users SHALL be able to define win/loss conditions based on wedge outcomes

### Requirement 5: Rich Media Support

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to add images, videos, and rich text to wedges, so that I can create visually engaging and themed games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding media to a wedge THEN users SHALL be able to upload or link to images
2. WHEN adding media to a wedge THEN users SHALL be able to upload or link to videos
3. WHEN a wedge with media is selected THEN the media SHALL be displayed prominently
4. WHEN media is displayed THEN it SHALL not interfere with game flow or performance
5. IF media fails to load THEN the wedge SHALL fall back to text display

### Requirement 6: Weighted Probability System

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to control outcome probabilities independently of visual wedge sizes, so that I can create balanced gameplay regardless of visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring wedge weights THEN the selection probability SHALL be proportional to the weight value
2. WHEN visual wedge sizes differ from weights THEN selection SHALL still follow the configured weights
3. WHEN weights are modified THEN the probability distribution SHALL update immediately
4. WHEN testing with deterministic RNG THEN weight distribution SHALL be statistically accurate over large samples
5. IF all weights are equal THEN each wedge SHALL have equal probability of selection

### Requirement 7: Preset Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and share game configurations, so that I can reuse favorite setups and share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a game configuration THEN users SHALL be able to save it as a named preset
2. WHEN loading a preset THEN all wheel configurations, rules, and settings SHALL be restored exactly
3. WHEN exporting a preset THEN it SHALL be saved as a JSON file for sharing
4. WHEN importing a preset JSON THEN it SHALL recreate the exact game configuration
5. IF localStorage is available THEN presets SHALL persist between browser sessions

### Requirement 8: Audio and Visual Theming

**User Story:** As a player, I want customizable themes with sounds and visual effects, so that the game feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wheels are spinning THEN appropriate sound effects SHALL play
2. WHEN a wheel stops THEN a distinct sound SHALL indicate the result
3. WHEN applying a theme THEN colors, fonts, and visual styles SHALL update consistently
4. WHEN sound is enabled THEN all audio SHALL be controllable via volume settings
5. IF audio is disabled THEN the game SHALL remain fully functional without sound

### Requirement 9: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As someone familiar with the current wheel, I want the enhanced version to preserve existing functionality, so that the transition is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced game loads THEN it SHALL display dual wheels similar to the current implementation
2. WHEN using basic spinning THEN it SHALL work similarly to the current power meter system
3. WHEN editing wedge text THEN it SHALL be as simple as the current input system
4. WHEN viewing results THEN they SHALL be displayed clearly like the current output
5. IF advanced features are not used THEN the game SHALL function as a simple wheel spinner

### Requirement 10: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly and reliably, so that gameplay is not interrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN it SHALL maintain consistent frame rates during animations
2. WHEN large media files are used THEN they SHALL not cause performance degradation
3. WHEN the browser is resized THEN the game SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
5. IF the browser lacks certain features THEN the game SHALL degrade gracefully with fallbacks
